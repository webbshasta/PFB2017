Somebody by Shel Silverstein

Somebody loves me,
Somebody cares,
Somebody picks me peaches and pears.
Somebody offers me candy and Cokes,
Somebody listens and laughs at me jokes.
Somebody helps when I get in a fight,
Somebody does all my homework at night.
Somebody misses me,
Somebody cries,
Somebody thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Somebody is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Somebody just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Somebody's hand,
In the darkness where Somebody usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Somebody's gone!
